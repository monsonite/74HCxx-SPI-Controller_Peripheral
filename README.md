# 74HCxx-SPI-Controller_Peripheral
SPI controller and peripherals based on 74HCxx Logic

Interfacing to SPI peripheral and memory devices is easy if you have a microcontroller, a few lines of code either with an SPI peripheral or by GPIO bit-banging, but what if you wish to return to first principles and make use of discrete 74HCxx logic devices?
