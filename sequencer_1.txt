RV32-WUJI

This Chinese development from the Fudan University and Shaoxin Laboratory, slipped under the RADAR, back in April this year.

There appears to be two separate developments, firstly, a new semiconductor process based on molybdenum di-sulphide (MoS2) substrate, and FETs, just three atomic layers thick.

Secondly, the team managed to prove their design by implementing a 5931 transistor RISC V CPU.

The first point is interesting, in that researchers are looking for new semiconductors and processes that go beyond silicon.

The second point is not so great. They have created a 32-bit, bit serial CPU in slightly less than 6000 transistors.


SPI controller and peripherals based on 74HCxx Logic.

Interfacing to SPI peripheral and memory devices is easy if you have a microcontroller.

With just a few lines of code either with an SPI peripheral or by GPIO bit-banging, SPI is easily implemented.

But what if you wish to return to first principles and use discrete 74HCxx logic devices?

The SPI bus is a bidirectional serial bus, that normally tranfers data in bytes.

It relies on 4 signals, plus power and ground:

/CE  Chip Enable -  active low,  enables the peripheral device
MOSI  Data transmitted for controller to peripheral
MISO  Data received from peripheral by controller
SCLK  A data clock which simultaneously clocks data out of the controller and receives data from the peripheral.

These signals must be co-ordinated using a state machine.

The controller and peripheral can simultaneously transfer data between a pair of shift registers, such as the 74HC595 or parallel tristate, bus-friendly 74HC299.

For the state machine, we can use a decade counter-decoder, such as the 74HC4017. This will give us 10 decoded timing pulses, which we can use to create the state machine control signals.
